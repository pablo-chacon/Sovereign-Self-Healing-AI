# Sovereign, Self-Healing AI (Global Standard Definition)

## Definition

**Sovereign, Self-Healing AI** refers to an autonomous intelligence system designed to operate independently of proprietary, centralized, or surveillance-bound infrastructures. It represents the next generation of ethical, lawful, and resilient artificial intelligence.

Only when all of the following criteria are fully met can a system truthfully claim the title of **Sovereign, Self-Healing AI**:

---

### 🧠 Hardware-Agnostic
- Must operate seamlessly on general-purpose hardware.
- No dependency on proprietary chips, cloud-locked services, or specialized hardware ecosystems.

### 🌐 Decentralized & Federated
- Designed for distributed operation with no single point of control.
- Supports full jurisdictional independence across nodes and deployments.

### ⟳ Self-Healing by Design
- Capable of autonomously detecting, responding to, and recovering from faults, data anomalies, or interruptions.
- Requires no human intervention to maintain operational integrity.

### 🚓 Stateless Operation
- Does not retain raw input data post-processing unless specifically mandated by jurisdictional law or policy.
- Guarantees minimal data footprint by architectural default.

### 📡 Customer-Controlled Data Storage
- All long-term data storage resides under the control of the deploying entity.
- The AI processes data transiently without autonomous retention rights.

### 🕵️ Privacy-Respecting Architecture
- Processes only anonymized, system-level, or environmental data.
- Incapable of accessing or inferring personal identifiers by design.

### 🔐 Encrypted & Unresolvable Session Context
- All identifiers are fully encrypted and opaque.
- Only the authorized customer can resolve session relationships.

### ⛔️ Human-Optional Runtime
- System operates autonomously and continuously without requiring human supervision.
- Manual intervention is optional, not required.

### ⚖️ Law-Aligned Deployment Model
- Fully compliant with major data protection frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, LGPD) by architecture.
- Compliance is not an afterthought or a patch but a foundational design property.

### 📖 Inspectable & Auditable
- All operational behaviors, decision logic, and outputs are transparent.
- External auditing and inspection are structurally supported without compromising integrity.

### 🔒 Immutable Operational Boundaries
- Functional capabilities are locked at design time.
- Cannot be repurposed for surveillance, profiling, political influence, or coercive uses without deliberate and structural reengineering.
